<h1> SphereView
  <img align="right" alt="Project logo" src="../assets/Icon.png" width=128px>
</h1>

A UIKit View that aligns given subviews as sphere.

## How To Use
Simply add **SphereView** as subview to your view and add all sphere elements as subview of the contentview. They are automatically arranged as spheres with the same distance between them. Or you can subclass **SphereView**.

> [!NOTE]  
> Subviews of **SphereView** are not lazy loaded or cached. How much subviews you can add to the contentView depends on your hardware limitations.
